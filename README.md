# Review-Classification-using-SVC
Implementation of NLP on Restaurant reviews using support vector classification and principle component analysis.

Overview:
  >The code uses Support vector classifier (SVC) from the svm class of sklearn. 
  >The dataset consists of various reviews given by customers of a restaurant.
  >The reviews are labeled as 0 or 1. 0 being negative and 1 being positive.

Code:
  > Stop words removal
  > Stemming
  > Vectorizing the string to numerical value
  > Applying PCA to reduce time complexity and increase accuracy of the model
  > Train SVC.
  > Test trained model.
  > Evaluate.
  > Save as joblib or pickle.
